Self-Catering:

Public Commutes:

Minimalist Packing:
Be selective with packing to dodge oversized luggage costs, sticking to the necessities. Light packing is not only economical; it makes traveling more convenient.

Local Insights:
Converse with residents for insider knowledge on economical choices. They might point you towards low-priced eateries, off-the-beaten-path sights, and distinctive yet affordable experiences.
